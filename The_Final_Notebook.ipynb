Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop Attachment The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & Primer BEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.

Designed by interior architect and furniture designer Francisco Segarra, this tile is a true reflection of vintage industrial design. Realistic imitations of scuffs and spots that are the marks of well-loved, worn, century-old tile bring rustic charm to any interior setting.

Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop Attachment The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & Primer BEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.

Featuring a worn cement appearance, this tile is a subtle statement piece created by floral motifs in faded shades of beige set on an antique white base glaze. Designed by interior architect and furniture designer Francisco Segarra, this tile is a true reflection of vintage industrial design. Realistic imitations of scuffs and spots that are the marks of well-loved, worn, century-old tile bring rustic charm to any interior setting.

The scored grout lines can be grouted with the color of your choice, or left ungrouted for a rugged finish. Its durable, ADA-compliant and glazed features make this tile an ideal choice for indoor residential use, including kitchen backsplashes, bathrooms and showers.

Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop Attachment The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & Primer BEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.

Whole House Fan Seal Radiant Barrier with Hook and Loop Attachment The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is an energy-saving insulating seal for whole house attic fans. It reduces air-leakage through the whole house attic fan saving the homeowner heating and cooling loss and energy costs. The Battic Door Whole House Attic Fan Ceiling Shutter Seal is easily installed over the fan louver from the house side in the fall and removed in the spring. Or leave on all year long to prevent HVAC loss. No need to enter the attic to install the kit. By reducing the amount of heat and moisture leaking into your attic, the severity of ice dams and attic mold is greatly reduced. The back of the foam is reflective, reflecting attic heat away from house in summer and reflecting heating back into house in winter. Kits are easy to install. Simply trim-to-fit. Each kit includes a supply of white foam (3/16 in., thick R-8) and white hook and loop. The flat-white colored foam has a textured finish and blends in with the ceiling. The foam is a solid-core that trims easily with scissors - it cannot unravel and does not have any frayed edges. May also be used to cover and seal AC vents and returns.\",\n          \"1 qt. #560A-2 Morning Breeze Satin Enamel Exterior Paint & Primer BEHR ULTRA Exterior Paint & Primer delivers excellent durability and stain-blocking properties.
